C++ is hard. It's been a long time since I've used it.

So I thought I would try to brush up on my skills with something that high level languages make trival: interacting with a web API.

This requires rapidjson. I don't know how you're supposed to handle requirements in c++ yet. So here's a link to it: https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson

And libcurl. sudo apt-get libcurl-devl or whatever.

You'll want to fix the build script to not my home directory.
